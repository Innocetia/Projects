This repository contains a series of mini projects designed to reinforce core concepts in SQL. It focuses on practical applications of key topics such as SQL Fundamentals, Joins, and Aggregate Functions. Each project demonstrates how to apply SQL to solve real-world data problems, using clean and well-structured queries. These exercises go beyond individual HackerRank-style problems and aim to simulate how SQL is used in actual data tasks â€” from selecting and filtering data to combining tables and summarizing information. This repo complements my separate HackerRank Challenges repository, which includes foundational Python and SQL challenges, and together they reflect my commitment to building strong, hands-on data skills through continuous learning.
